# Library Management System

## Problem statement

The current process of managing a library can lack efficiency, accuracy, and security, making it difficult to maintain data consistency and integrity. Therefore, there is a need to develop a Library Management System that can manage basic library operations, including adding new books, updating information, searching books and members, issuing and returning books, and maintaining late fines. The primary aim of this project is to develop a Library Management System that automates the processes involved in managing a library and enhances the user experience.


## Project Description

This project aims to build a Library Management System which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new books, updating information, searching books and members, issuing and returning books, and maintaining late fines. We can enter the record of new books and retrieve the details of books available in the library. We can issue the books to the students and maintain their records and can also check how many books are issued and stock available in the library.
